# command-line-uno
Play uno from the command-line!


Important Note:

This project is far from complete, and not really playable as of now, because it's still in its development stages.
If you have a decent working knowledge of C/C++ and you have basic familiarity with pointer and data
manipulation, and are comfortable with C's complicated declarations (such as the difference between the declaration
that declares an array of pointers to pointers, versus a declaration that declares an array of arrays of pointers),
then you'll likely find fun in configuring the source files to make the program do what you want. It's very important
to note that if you hastily proceed to compiling and running the program, you'll likely be disappointed in the results
because, as mentioned, the game is not yet ready to be played; not only that, but the program itself is likely not even
ready to be executed yet as I am making a huge data structure migration from too much array involvement to balancing the
data structures of the deck stack, table stack, and user stacks to have a sweet-spot of involvement between arrays and
structs (makes the development process way more efficient). As we're speaking, this project currently only does administrative
stuff that allow you to use single-character options to manipulate the entire uno deck, the game table, and the users in the
game. It is not ready to be played yet, and the only reason I uploaded this project early was because I am too lazy to find
another back-up method while switching my Linux distribution. If you have anything you would like to personally contribute,
do not hesitate to open a pull-request so I can see your contributing code and how it might help make this small project better!
Otherwise, feel free to modify it on your own machine locally with the only limit being you. Enchant√©! (hopefully, I didn't butcher that)
